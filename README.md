Student Grade Tracker
Objective:
The Student Grade Tracker program is designed to help teachers efficiently manage and analyze student grades. It allows the teacher to input grades for multiple students and then calculates the average, highest, and lowest grades, providing a quick overview of student performance.

Key Features:

Input Handling:

The program begins by asking the teacher to specify the number of students whose grades need to be tracked.
It then prompts the teacher to enter the grades for each student. These grades are stored in an ArrayList, which provides flexibility in case the number of students varies.
Grade Calculations:

Average Grade Calculation: The program calculates the average grade by summing all the grades and dividing by the total number of students.
Highest Grade: The program identifies the highest grade among all students by iterating through the ArrayList.
Lowest Grade: Similarly, the program finds the lowest grade in the list.
Output:

After processing the data, the program displays the average grade, the highest grade, and the lowest grade to the teacher. This information helps in quickly assessing the overall performance of the class.
